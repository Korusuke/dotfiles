# dotfiles

Not just a dotfiles repo. It's more like a set of auto-setup scripts that can be used to configure fresh VMs, servers etc..

It was inspired by the 100's of similar repo's out there and also a tiny bit of necessity as I was super done with looking up the DigitalOcean guide on installing docker everytime I spinned up a new VM.
## Configuration Steps

**Note** : Only exectute the following commands if you are sure! They may/will results in data loss.


```bash
git clone https://github.com/korusuke/dotfiles
cd dotfiles && bash install.sh (server | essentials | full)
```
